- 👋 Hi, I’m @bharanu
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Backend Development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Full Stack development projects.

👨‍💻 I enjoy contributing to Open Source Projects. I am really enthusiastic about learning new technology. In 2022, I learned React, Progressive Web App (PWA), MongoDB, Postgres and Blockchain development. I got started with Freelancing and Blogging quite recently and made a name for myself.
📚 I also love reading books on personal development & financial literacy. My favorite ones are The Compound Effect by Darren Hardy in the genre of personal development and Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki in the genre of financial literacy.
✈️ I love traveling too.
